# Will o Wisp

> THE Will-o'-the-Wisp is out on the marsh,
> 
> And all alone he goes;
> 
> There's not a sight of his glimmering light
> 
> From break of day to close;
> 
> But all night long, from dusk till dawn,
> 
> He drifts where the night wind blows.
> 
> â€” Annie Campbell Huestis 

When night sets on your application Will o Wisp lights up to let you know.
